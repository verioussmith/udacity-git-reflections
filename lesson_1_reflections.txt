How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	• The diff put the two files specific changes side by side and included specific code number lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    • It could help me identify bad habits, improve my overall coding skills, keep a log of how my coding skills have improved overtime.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    • I think the pros are that I will be more coscious of what I am writing and when I am saving.   The manual save will also likely have the effect of helping me to remember what i have written in the code to a greater degree.

    • The cons could be that i do have to manually save and there is a possibility that I will forget to commit at times.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    • I think this probably has something to do with the ability to be abe to compare the changes that have been commited in one version versus another.  This is a more granular approach that leads to greater control which is needed in software development.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    • Git log - allows me to see the log history and id of every commit.  Git Diff allows me to compare the difference of 2 different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    • GIT version control would give me the confidence to expeeriment mor and write things in code that could possibly break the system beacuse I would not manually have to remember every piece of code. I could keep code clean because I could commit changes and then add new features.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
